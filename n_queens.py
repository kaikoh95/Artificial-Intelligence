"""N-queens puzzle is the mathematical generalisation of the 
well-known eight queens puzzle. Using non-chess terms, the objective 
is to place n objects on an nÃ—n board (grid), such that no two objects 
are in the same row, column or diagonal. n is alway a positive integer.

Traditionally, the rows and columns of the board are numbered from 1 to 
n where the position (1,1) can be arbitrarily chosen to be any of the 
squares at the four corners of the board. Using this numbering scheme, 
for example, an assignment in which the positions (5,6) and (5,8) are 
occupied or an assignment in which the positions (3,7)  and (7,7) are 
occupied, are not solutions because in these assignments, two objects 
share the same row or column. Also, for example, having an object at 
(2, 4) and another object at (5, 7) is illegal because the two objects 
share the same diagonal. 

Finding solutions for an n queens puzzle can be computationally expensive 
but by using an appropriate representation and search method, the required 
computational effort can be reduced. In the following, we will solve this 
puzzle (for large values of n) using CSP and local search techniques.
